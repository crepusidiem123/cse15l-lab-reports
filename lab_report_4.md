In order to find the ssh command that I typed in the history, I pressed \<ctrl>+r to enable reverse search. Then I typed "ssh" to search for ssh history. Since the one appears in the screen is the one that I am looking for, I pressed \<enter> to execute the command. Due to the set up the ssh key beforehand, I would not need to log in.

Since I've cloned the forked repository once while doing the lab, again, I pressed \<ctrl>+r to enable reverse search. Then I typed "git clone" to search for cloning history. Since the one appears in the screen is the one that I am looking for, I pressed \<enter> to execute the command.

I pressed "cd lab7" to change my working directory to lab7, and then pressed bash t+\<tab> so that the bash autofills the remaining part. Then I pressed \<enter> to start the test.

## Step 7

I pressed vim L+\<tab> to autofill to ListExample and typed .j+\<tab> to autofill the suffix. Then I pressed \<enter> to edit the file.

Given that I know it's in line 44, I pressed 43j to navigate to the line of the mistake, pressing \<ctrl>+a to increment the first number in this line by one, then typing :wq to exit vim.

Then I pressed \<up>\<up> to trace back to when I ran the test, pressing \<enter> to retest the files. The output indicates that I have passed those tests.

Firstly, I used git status to check where I am at. Seeing such output, I typed git add L+\<tab>.j+\<tab>, again, to autofill the path.

Then I typed git commit -m "fixation" to commit it to the github account, and it successfully did it with the messages above.
